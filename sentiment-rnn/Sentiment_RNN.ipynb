    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."

    "\n",
    "The first step when building a neural network model is getting your data into the proper form to feed into the network. Since we're using embedding layers, we'll need to encode each word with an integer. We'll also want to clean it up a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example of the reviews data above. We'll want to get rid of those periods. Also, you might notice that the reviews are delimited with newlines `\\n`. To deal with those, I'm going to split the text into each review using `\\n` as the delimiter. Then I can combined all the reviews back together into one big string.\n",

it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles  young frankenstein  or spaceballs for the matter  to show what it  s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don  t know what to do with their money  maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly

tile airport     this second sequel to the smash  hit disaster thriller airport       was directed by jerry jameson  while once again like it  s predecessors i can  t say airport    is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons  out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best  just  it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid  air hi  jacking  then the crashing  didn  t he see the oil rig    sinking of the     maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure         submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside  either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the    floods or if any of the doors are opened  it  s a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character  s  dull dialogue  lethargic set  pieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity  while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for    odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  there  s not as much urgency as i thought there should have been  even when the navy become involved things don  t pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but there  s just something lacking here  george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background   br    br   the home video  theatrical version of airport    run    minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence  many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni  flashbacks to flesh out character  s  longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator  while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport     as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices  i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren  t great either  along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award  s hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that  s a little harsh  the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately  the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly   br    br   the production values are alright if nothing spectacular  the acting isn  t great  two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this  one time oscar winner james stewart looks old  frail  also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too   br    br   airport    is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far  i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly  the production  bland direction doesn  t help though  a film about a sunken plane just shouldn  t be this boring or lethargic  followed by the concorde    airport            ', 'brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren  best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none  the corn on face is a classic  as good as anything in blazing saddles  the take on lawyers is also superb  after being accused of being a turncoat  selling out his boss  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  i  m a lawyer  he says  three funny words  jeffrey tambor  a favorite from the later larry sanders show  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto  his character is more malevolent than usual  the hospital scene  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site  are all  time classics  look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  one bleeds   this movie gets better each time i see it  which is quite often    ', 'this film lacked something i couldn  t put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress  this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man  even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play  it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors  i just don  t know   br    br   but could it have been the screenplay  just exactly who was the chef in love with  he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant  and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits  than of anybody or anything else  he never convinced me he was in love with the princess   br    br   i was disappointed in this movie  but  don  t forget it was nominated for an oscar  so judge for yourself   ', 'this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon  sure  its flawed  it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots   many of the jokes fall flat  but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive  its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either  my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead    ', 'sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch  although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch  the absence of a sound track was brutal  the loooonnnnng shots were too long  how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining  i really had a hard time just getting through this film  the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene  otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman  and i  m no fan f his either  i think anyone who says they enjoyed     hours of this is   well  lying   ', 'this is not the typical mel brooks film  it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable  leslie ann warren made the movie  she is such a fantastic  under  rated actress  there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more  and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so  but all in all  this is worth the price to rent and see it  the acting was good overall  brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience  again  warren was the best actor in the movie  but  fume  and  sailor  both played their parts well   ', 'when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors  it was one of many movies i watched with my parents  but this was the only one we walked out of  since then i had never seen interiors until just recently  and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it  what a pretentious  ponderous  and painfully boring piece of    s wine and cheese tripe  woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career  in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman  allen gives us a dark  angular  muted  insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce  estrangement  career  love  non  love  halitosis  whatever  the film  intentionally  has no comic relief  no music  and is drenched in shadowy pathos  this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature  using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a  more pronounced depth of meaning and truth   but woody allen is no ingmar bergman  the film is painfully slow and dull  but beyond that  i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters  instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling  whining  nicotine stained  martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity  amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room  everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes  everyone is  lost  and  struggling   desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them  it  s never about resolution  it  s only about interminable introspective babble  it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience  s ability to connect  woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out  and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining  i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance  i highly recommend this one if you  re feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death  otherwise  let  s just pretend this film never happened   ', 'this isn  t the comedic robin williams  nor is it the quirky  insane robin williams of recent thriller fame  this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over  dramatization  mixed with robin  s new love of the thriller  but this isn  t a thriller  per se  this is more a mystery  suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper   br    br   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report  until william  s character gets close to achieving his goal   br    br   i must say that i was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse  it felt more like i was watching a guy  williams   as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective  in other words  it felt real  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story   br    br   all in all  it  s worth a watch  though it  s definitely not friday  saturday night fare   br    br   it rates a       from     br    br   the fiend    ', '  it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable   and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman  and let  s not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen  s bergman pretensions  allen  s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding  what i don  t get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  ripping off  hitchcock in his suspense  horror films  in robin wood  s view  it  s a strange form of cultural snobbery  i would have to agree with that   ', 'yes its an art    to successfully make a slow paced thriller   br    br   the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don  t even notice it happening   br    br   fine performance by robin williams  the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film  however  the core plot is very engaging  the movie doesn  t rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering  the direction is good  use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good   br    br   very nice  time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story   ', 'the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than   years to
